This is my first ever TOP coding project. The task at hand is to recreate the Google homepage. While it is not necessary to create a fully functioning copy of mentioned page, by the end my copy is supposed to at least resemble the page looks-wise. 

At first I will focus on the basic html structure and adding the Google logo. 

The second part will then focus on styling the page with a few simple CSS lines and to structure every part of the page the way it is structured in the original.
